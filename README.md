## Purpose and Target Users
### Purpose
Food waste is a huge problem in the United States. We want to create an app that will allow our users to track their foodâ€™s expiration dates, preventing food waste. Our app will give reminders to our users so they can consume their food before it goes bad.

#### Note: make sure to also check out our widget we created with the app! If it doesn't show up at first, switch the target to XPIRE-widget and run it, it should pop up.
